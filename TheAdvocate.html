<p align="center" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Open Sans'; font-size:14pt;">January 31, 1993</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Open Sans'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">Hebrews 7:18–28</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">We’ve finished up a series on the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">Hard Sayings of Jesus</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">, and we’re about to go back into Ephesians and try to continue through that book, as we’ve been doing in the evening service. Tonight, partly because I knew it would be something of an unusual night, sort of a gap between, I want to talk about a subject I’m constantly talking about in pieces, but I do not remember the last time I went through and looked at this very important, very critical, and very practical Christian doctrine in a more full way to this body.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I’d like for us tonight to consider together Hebrews 7, and I’m going to read from verses 19–28. The subject is the doctrine of the high priestly, heavenly intercession of Jesus Christ. The title is “Jesus, Our Advocate.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">18 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">19 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">20 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">21 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest forever.’ ”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">22 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">23 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">24 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">25 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">26 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Such a high priest meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">27 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; vertical-align:super;">28 </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:18px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">This is God’s Word</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">That’s an extremely important passage, and I would just like to lead you through it. I would like you to see most of the time when we think about Christ’s work for us, when we think of how he saved us and what he does for us, we almost always think of the past, or we think of the future. We know in the past he died on the cross for us, and he was raised. We know in the future he is returning, and he’s going to put everything right. We almost always think of the past and the future when we think about how Jesus is saving us from our problems, the brokenness of the world, evil, and sin.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I would like you to see tonight maybe the most important thing he does is what he’s doing in the present, something he’s doing this?? instant. This text clearly is giving you the framework of the Old Testament tabernacle or temple. It’s trying to help you understand the work Jesus does for us right now in the present tense in terms of that temple. We know from the Old Testament the temple and the tabernacle … The tabernacle came first; it was a tent. The temple came later; it was a building.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">In both cases, there was an altar out front where an animal was slain. The people prayed in the outer court, but then there was a little cubicle. It was completely surrounded. It was a perfect square and cube surrounded by heavy curtains, and inside that arena was the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies was the place where the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">shekinah</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> glory of God, his radiance, dwelled. He dwelled over the ark of the covenant, and only one person could go there, the high priest, and only once a year.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">The high priest once a year would come and sacrifice an animal, go back into the Holy of Holies, and represent the people. He would go there as the mediator, as the representative, of the people. He would pray for us, and he would offer a sacrifice for our sins and seek to procure the favor of God for the people for the coming year.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I think if we’re really going to understand this text, we have to do a little bit of translation because, unfortunately, for modern people a temple doesn’t seem to really make things coherent. The concept of the temple is not a familiar one. Blood, gore, incense, smoke, curtains, priests, and people walking around in sequined gowns with long beards … It doesn’t exactly relate, and yet this particular doctrine I want to show you is saying </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Jesus Christ is the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">real</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> High Priest who makes the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">real</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> offering, goes </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">really</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> into the presence of God, and there procures his love, grace, and favor for us.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">The trouble with using the temple illustration is it doesn’t relate very well to modern people, but the doctrine does. I’d like to show you if you understand, then believe, and then apply this truth to yourself, this is dynamite. This material, this doctrine, is absolute dynamite. It will transform any life, any community, any church, and any city where people get it. Here’s why. This doctrine is really about what you look like. What do you really look like?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">A couple of years ago, I read in the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">New York Times Magazine</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> a very interesting column by a woman, and this is what she said: “More than 40 years of looking at myself in a mirror has left me like so many women I know, almost totally ignorant of what I look like. In the mirror I see, not reality, but a composite of memories, wishes, half-truths, and old photographs. I’ve learned to live with my shadow self. I know there’s a real me lurking in there somewhere, but I can’t seem to find her.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">The article goes on to say, “I don’t know what I look like. Every time I look in the mirror, I think …” This column goes on and says she finally goes to a Manhattan image consultant, shells out $750, and says, “Find the real me.” She figured at least here’s a guy who would be objective, and he was an expert. So he redoes her and says, “This is what you really look like. This will bring out this, and this will bring out this.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">So she comes home, the new her. She likes the way she looks. She looks so professional, so sophisticated, and better than she has ever looked. She walks in the door, and the column goes on and says the first thing that happens is her 7-year-old boy walks up, sees her, screams, and cries for 20 minutes. Her husband … is noncommittal. The way the column ends is she says, “I think this is the real me, but I don’t look like Mommy anymore. Who am I really?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">She’s only talking about the physical, but she’s actually hinting at a deeper problem. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">What do you really look like? I find, no matter whom I’m talking to, I’m talking to them through a role. To my parents I’m a son. To my children I’m a father. To my wife I’m a husband. To the people who have heard me preach, and who come to my church, it’s so easy for me to see the radical difference with which people treat me. If you’ve been here, and if you haven’t been here. To some of you I’m a preacher. I’m a communicator. To some other people I’m not. I’m something else.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">The point is who am I? Who am I really? What’s really bad … what do I really look like? </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Everybody in this room has some people who really don’t like you at all</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">. You might be a very popular minister. It doesn’t matter how popular you are. There’s a steady stream of people every year in the most popular ministries who leave out the back door saying, “What a terrible person that minister is!”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Many of you have had broken marriages, and there’s somebody walking around who thinks you’re awful. Are you as bad as some of these people say? You’ve been in work situations where, as far as you know, you did the right thing. Other people think you stabbed them in the back. “You didn’t get things done. You made me look bad.” There are a lot of people walking around who really think you’re a fairly terrible person.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Who are you? What do you really look like? Are you beautiful or are you ugly? The biblical answer is right here. How do you find out who you really are, what you really look like, whether you’re really as good as those people say, you’re really as bad as those people say, or whether you’re kind of in the middle, like you say, “How do you know? How do you know what you really look like?” The answer is here.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">First, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">God’s eye is the only objective eye.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> It’s not the image consultant who’s objective and certainly not anybody else. God’s eye is the only eye that counts. His view of you is the only one that matters. Secondly, as it says here, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">if you come to God in Christ</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">in God’s sight you are beautiful</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">. You are a surpassing beauty. You are gorgeous. That’s what it says. If you get ahold of that as Paul did, you can face anything.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I know you don’t have ahold of this. I know who you are. I’ve talked to you, and I see you. None of us have a grip on it like Paul does. You take a look at Romans 8. There’s this incredible climax in Paul’s letter, Romans 8. At a certain point he says, “If God is for us, who can be against us?” He goes on: “Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? What can separate us from the love of Christ?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Then he says, “For it is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? It is Christ who died, who is risen, yea, who intercedes for us at the right hand of God. Nothing will separate us from the love of God, neither famine, nor nakedness, nor peril, nor sword. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor anything in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">How can Paul talk like that? Right in the center of it he says, “Because Jesus is interceding for me.” That’s the reason why he says, “I don’t care what anybody thinks.” “Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect?” “It doesn’t matter. I know I’m loved. It doesn’t matter. God is for me …” How does he know God is for him all the time? “… and in that case, who can be against us? If I can look God in the eye, I can spit in the eye of the world,” says Paul.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> Where does it come from?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Right in the heart of that Romans 8, right in the heart of that climax, he has this towering, unassailable confidence. Where does it come from? “It is Christ that died …” And then he says, “… yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.” Maybe you’ve heard of this doctrine before, maybe you haven’t heard of this doctrine before, but I think all of us have to agree it doesn’t operate in our lives like that. Paul knows what he looks like. Paul doesn’t look in the mirror and wonder. Paul knows what he looks like.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:18px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Open Sans'; font-size:14pt; font-weight:600;">1. The teaching about the doctrine</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">What I want to show you is what this passage teaches us about the doctrine of the high priestly intercession of Christ. First of all, I want to look at what the teaching is, and then I want to show you how it applies, how it affects us, if we really take it into our hearts. This passage tells us the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">nature of this high priestly work</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">his credentials for his work</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">, and thirdly, </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">the results of his work</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">A. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">The nature of the work.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> It says in verse 25, “Therefore he is able to save completely [to the uttermost] those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede …” What does </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">intercede</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> mean? It means to stand in. In 1 John 2:1, it says, “Little children, I don’t want you to sin, but if you sin, we have an interceder with the Father.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">In the old King James Version, it says, “… we have an advocate with the Father …” In some modern translations, it says, “We have one who speaks on our behalf.” One of the most useful illustrations, in fact, I would say it’s an illustration that has changed my life, I discovered in an old book of sermons called </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">Princeton Sermons</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> preached by Charles Hodge in 1850 in a chapel of seminary students at Princeton.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">In it he said modern people have a lot of trouble relating to intercession within the framework of a temple, but modern people do not have that much of a problem understanding intercession within the framework of a court. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">When the Bible says Jesus is our High Priest, he means Jesus is your defense attorney in court. That opened for me a tremendous understanding.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Let’s just say you are on trial, and, therefore, you have to defend yourself in court. Unless you think much more highly of yourself than you should, you know you need a lawyer. Why? You’re not qualified to go in there and defend yourself. Occasionally, there are people who think they can, but they don’t understand how it works. They’re not qualified. They don’t have the background. They don’t have the smarts. They don’t have the ability. They don’t have the knowledge.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">So what do you do? </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">You hire an attorney. That attorney through a legal transaction becomes you in court. What do you look like to the court? You look like your attorney. If your attorney is eloquent, if your attorney is polished, if your attorney is skilled, you’re eloquent, polished, and skilled. You may in some cases not even appear in court. You are your attorney, or the way Charles Hodge put it in that sermon preached so many years ago, you are lost in your advocate. You’re hidden in your advocate.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Some people say, “This isn’t fair. If my attorney screws up, I die. If my attorney does well, I live.” Yeah, but that’s the nature of the relationship. It’s a legal relationship. Your attorney stands in for you, and as a result the benefits or the failures of your attorney are imputed to you. The success of your attorney is your success. The failure of your attorney is your failure. That’s the nature of the case.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">I think Charles Hodge is absolutely right. As soon as we begin to think, not so much of the priesthood and think of the temple (that might work in many cultures for a lot of ancient people), as soon as we begin to realize what it means for Jesus to be a High Priest, Jesus Christ becomes our Defense Attorney, our Advocate. You’re lost in your Advocate. You </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">are</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> your Advocate to the court. However your Advocate looks to the court, you look like it. “Don’t hire a jerk,” they say, “because then you are a jerk legally. Hire someone who’s able to represent you well.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">That exactly is the nature of Jesus Christ’s relationship to anyone who is a Christian. It’s a legal thing. It’s a status thing. There’s a legal transaction, and </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">voila</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">! Suddenly you become your attorney before the court, before the judge, and before the bar. We are all, the Bible says, standing judged before the judgment seat, the court of heaven, and at that court, if you’re a Christian, Jesus stands today now as your Advocate.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I know what I’m telling you is good news, yet those of you who are discerning will recognize I have slipped a lot of bad news in here along with the good news. In other words, some of you are saying, “Wait a minute. This sounds all very good, but you are assuming this whole idea there is this judgment seat in heaven, there’s this law of God, I’m a guilty sinner, and I’m on trial for my life. Where do you get all that?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">That was very discerning of you to see all this good news assumes the whole idea of a judgment seat, a heavenly judgment seat, a heavenly court, and an eternal law of God before which we all stand condemned. Just briefly, I want to thank you and compliment you of seeing how I was slipping that in there, and I won’t do it again. I’ll come right and tell you, “Yes, that’s the case.” I don’t have to necessarily just say yes because the Bible says so; I believe you know it. I believe your own heart knows it. I urge you to listen to what your own heart says.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">There is not just an </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">indelibility</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> about guilt; there’s an </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">immediacy</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> about it. Why is it you may be walking along, and all of a sudden this slideshow starts to go on in your eyelids about all the things you’ve done wrong? Why is it sometimes your conscience can go crazy? Don’t forget who’s talking to you. “I’m a professional moral person,” they say. That’s what a clergyman is. “It’s my job to be a nice guy. It’s my job to be religious. It’s my job to do all of these things.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Let me tell you sometimes when you’re preaching suddenly there’s this laser light show that goes on in your conscience. Suddenly all kinds of amazingly vivid memories of things you’ve done come on in quadraphonic sound while you’re preaching, in your own head, and then the voice of the narrator comes on, and it says, “What are you doing here considering the things you’ve done?” I personally don’t think I’m alone. I believe everybody understands that.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">There’s a funny thing about guilt. It’s not just indelible. There’s an immediacy about it. Sometimes it seems like our conscience is getting some kind of outside influence that stirs it up. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">The Bible says it’s because your conscience is a radio receiver picking up the Prosecution. You do stand guilty before the judgment seat of heaven. There is a bar before which we all stand accused, and we know it.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I know so many people try to say if you feel guilty all the time, you have to minimize that. You have to say, “Well, everybody does it. You’re as good as most people.” That’s really not fair because no matter how hard you try to tell yourself, “I’m really a good person. I’m really a good person,” underneath your conscience knows the truth.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">There is a judgment seat before which we all stand. There is a bar. We know it. You know it. That’s the reason why you’re so doggone defensive when people criticize you, because down deep there’s that basic insecurity that comes from knowing we do stand before a judgment seat. We don’t love our neighbors as ourselves. We don’t love God like we ought to. We don’t live up to our own standards. Yes, absolutely, there’s an indelibility about guilt.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Samuel Johnson, the great man of letters, when he was a young boy, his father used to maintain a grocery stand on market days in a big marketplace in a place called Uttoxeter. One day his father asked Samuel to go and to man the stand, to be there and to run it, and he went and did something else. He never went there, and his father lost a lot of money. He never could overcome that. Years later, his father had died. He could never overcome the regrets he had in his relationship with his father.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">One day just to see if he could do something about it, he went to Uttoxeter, stood in that place 30 or 40 years after the day in which he had sinned, and stood there in the driving rain at the spot where his father’s grocery stand had been, bare-headed, trying like crazy to do something to get rid of what he called his secret discontent. “ ‘Out, damned spot!’ But I can’t get it out.” He couldn’t do it.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">All of us have, not just a kind of guilt we just can’t seem to get rid of, but our guilt somehow continually gets reinvigorated. There’s an immediacy about it. We know we’re guilty. We know we stand judged. We know we have failed. We know, and, therefore, we desperately need an advocate.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">B. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">The credentials of the work.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> The Bible tells us right here Jesus Christ does stand as our Advocate, and he has two credentials in order to do the job. The first is in verse 27: he’s perfect. The reason he can be an Advocate for us, it says in verse 27, is he’s perfect. “Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins …” Any lawyer who is himself or herself under indictment cannot stand in court. If you yourself need someone to represent you, you can’t be a representative.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Of course, we know except for Jesus Christ there isn’t any human being who could possibly stand as advocate. The first credential he has is a perfect life. He stands flawless representing you. No one can find any fault in him. The court loves him, but that’s not his only credential. The second credential he has is an absolutely infallible case, because in verse 27, it says, “… he does not need to offer sacrifices … first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.” Did you hear it?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">My life was completely changed when I realized Jesus Christ was my Advocate and he had a case. To be honest with you I didn’t realize emotionally one of the reasons why I was not able to really live in unassailable confidence before the Father was because … As a Christian I had heard for years Jesus Christ was my High Priest. He was my Defense Attorney. He was my Advocate. He stood before the Father, and he prayed for me. I had heard that before, but it didn’t really console me till I read that Charles Hodge sermon.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">I began to realize the reason Jesus is such a successful advocate is not simply because he’s perfect and he’s praying for me, but because he has a case. Some of you know it’s possible for lawyers, when they realize they have no case, to find all sorts of other ways to get their client off. You can do histrionics. You can do hysterics. You can do blackmail. You can buy the jury. You can use flowery words. You can do cartwheels. You can do all sorts of things to try to wheedle, cajole, get sympathy, and do all sorts of things when you don’t have a case. I always thought that’s really how Jesus must have been defending me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">I figured every single day Jesus would get up and say, “Father, I represent my client, Timothy James Keller. Yes, he did do it again, but cut him a break please, Father, for my sake, one more time. One more chance. Pretty please?” I thought the Father looked at him and said, “Well, all right.” Of course, my question was how long can Jesus do that? How many days? When does the Father finally say, “Even for </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">you</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">, I just can’t let Timothy James Keller off. One more time. How many times is he going to break his promises? How many times is he going to say this and do another thing?” I thought Jesus was up there as a great lawyer but without a case.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">The Bible here tells us that’s not true at all. As a matter of fact, the reason Jesus Christ is a perfect High Priest is because he has an absolutely infallible case. Do you know what that case is? I just read it. This is what Jesus is doing. “Father,” he says. “I represent my brothers and sisters. Father, you are just. Your law says if people treat one another this way, the wages of sin is death. Well, there look. See my blood. See my broken bones. There are the wages. There’s the payment. Father, because you are just, you could never take two payments for the same sin.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">That’s the case. Verse 27: “He sacrificed for their sins once for all …” What is he saying? He’s saying, “Father, I stand before this court, and I do not ask for mercy for my clients. I do not ask for mercy.” That’s not a case to ask for mercy. To make a case means you show what the law is. You show it. What does he say? “I do not ask for mercy for my brothers and sisters. I ask for justice. I have satisfied the law. I have paid. Look at my blood.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">It says in the book of Hebrews, it says Jesus’ blood speaks more graciously than the blood of Abel. Do you remember what happened when Cain killed Abel? God comes to Cain and says, “Where is Abel thy brother?” And he said, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” God says, “Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.” Cries out for what? Justice.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Yet Hebrews tells us Jesus Christ’s blood has also been spilled. It’s lying out there in the ground. Look at the gore of it, but it’s saying something else. It’s crying something else. It’s not crying out for justice. It’s crying out, “Grace!” Which means Jesus is saying, “I do not ask for mercy for my clients. Their sins are paid for. I ask for justice. Your own justice demands the acquittal of my brothers and sisters.” That is an infallible case. That’s an absolutely infallible case.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Whenever you ask for mercy … maybe, maybe not. Jesus is not asking for mercy. On the basis of his substitutionary death and on the basis of his life, his substitutionary intercession, the law of God and the righteousness and justice of God is completely now demanding our acquittal, demanding it. The justice of God, the Bible says, makes the mountains themselves look like specks of dust.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">If you put yourself in this part of the scale and you put the justice of God in the other part of the scale, you’ll be completely outweighed, but now the justice is on our side. That’s the reason why it says, “… he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him …” Now do you understand? It has nothing to do with what you’ve done. It has nothing to do with your record. It doesn’t matter tonight whether or not you have done things you will never be able to tell anybody. It doesn’t matter what you have accomplished. It doesn’t matter how alienated you are.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">“… he is able to save to the </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">uttermost</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> …” That’s a reaching word, because now Jesus Christ stands before the Father, and for anyone who has received him as Savior, he says, “I demand justice. You must accept. You must love. You must forgive. You must acquit.” What that means is when the Father looks at you, you’re lost in your Advocate.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">It’s just like Paul said when he was writing Philemon. Onesimus was a slave, and Philemon was his owner. Paul writes Philemon and says, “Onesimus is about to come to you. I want you to grant his freedom. Receive him as if you were receiving me, and if he owes you anything, charge it to my account.” That’s exactly what Jesus Christ says to the Father. “Receive them as you receive me, and if they owe you anything, I’ve paid it. Look.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">As a result of this, a Christian is somebody who never worries about today or tomorrow whether or not they’re going to slip in or out. The Father looks at you, and what do you see? The Bible tells us Jesus is the High Priest. Go look and see what the high priest wore. Go look at it. The high priest wore an ephod, a breastplate, and on it precious jewels on which the names of the tribes, the sons of Israel, were inscribed.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">So Jesus Christ goes before the Father, and your name is engraved in absolute beauty and glory over his heart. When the Father sees you, he sees something exquisite. Why? Not because of anything you’ve done, not because of your moral efforts. It happened the minute you said, “Be my Advocate. I can’t appear before the court in myself. If I try to do that, I’ll be slaughtered.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Of course, that’s just common sense. Nobody goes before the court without an attorney, without a good one. You have a perfect one, and you have one who has the case. Because of his perfect credentials, because of his perfect life, and because of his perfect case, “… he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him …”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">C. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">The results of the work.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;"> This is such a perfect Lawyer. In this case Jesus Christ doesn’t just get you acquitted. He gets you all of the rights and privileges. You are now lost in him. You are liable for everything Jesus is liable for. You are to get everything he deserves. That’s exactly what the whole image means. That’s what the metaphor means. That’s what the doctrine means.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">For example, why can you have the Holy Spirit? It says in the book of Luke God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey him. “The Holy Spirit, how we love to have the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the lifeblood of God. It’s the power of God, the joy, the nature of God, and the strength of God, but I don’t obey him. How can I get it?” It’s very simple. How do you get to him? How do you get the Holy Spirit? In John 14, Jesus says, “I have prayed for you so the Father will send you another Advocate, will send you the Holy Spirit.” You have the Holy Spirit completely and totally through the intercession of Christ.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Here’s another one: prayer itself. Your ability to pray to God is totally a function of the high priestly intercession of Jesus Christ. It says, for example, in Psalm 66, “If I cherish iniquity in my heart, he will not hear me.” Good night! Then why should he hear anybody? We’re all cherishing iniquity in our hearts, so that’s the end of that. Hebrews 4:15 says, “Because we have a High Priest who has been touch with our infirmities, who understands us, let us draw near.” Prayer is completely a function of his high priestly intercession.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I’ll tell you one more thing. Your assurance and your certainty he will never let you go, you will never lose him, and he will never lose you, all on the basis of the intercession of Christ. In Luke 22, before Peter is about to deny and betray his Master, Jesus comes to him and says, “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you.… And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Now did you hear that? Judas betrayed Jesus too. Why is it six weeks later Judas was rotting in the field of Aceldama and Peter was leading a movement that was about the change the history of the world? Do you know why? Because Peter was smarter? Peter was better? Peter was more resilient? “… I have prayed for you …” The transaction between Peter and Jesus that made Jesus his Advocate had never happened between Judas and Jesus.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">You notice Jesus doesn’t say, “I have prayed for you so </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">if</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> you turn,” does he? What does he say? “I have prayed for you so </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">when</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> you turn.” Why? Jesus has never, ever, ever, ever, can’t ever have a prayer for one of his own turned down because he has an infallible case, and he lives to intercede for you. It’s his life. When you live to do something, that means you get joy in it. You can never stop doing it. You can never get enough of it. He lives to intercede. That’s an incredible thing.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">It doesn’t just say he intercedes. It doesn’t just say he lives </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">and</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> intercedes. It says he lives </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic;">to</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> intercede for you and for me. Think of that. He says, “That’s what I’m built for. That’s what I’m here for. That’s my meaning in life.” I’m using anthropomorphisms, but it’s a frightening thing just to realize he is dedicated to you.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:18px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Open Sans'; font-size:14pt; font-weight:600;">2. The application of the doctrine</span></p>

First, do you have some guilt in your life? Do you have some things that make you feel unworthy? Ha! Two hundred years ago a man named Howell Harris, I think it was, was only 15 years old. He wasn’t a Christian yet, but he was going to become a great preacher later on. One of his aunts, a maiden aunt, had really had a very hard life, never gotten married, always lived in poverty, and she was about to die.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">In fact, everybody thought she had died. She had slipped away, and people said, “Well, it’s just terrible what a hard life she has had, and now she has to die like this. She’s only in her forties. She has had a hard life. She has always been poor, and it just doesn’t seem right.” She seemed to hear that, and she suddenly opened her eyes, sat up, and looked at the family. (Howell Harris never forgot this.) She looked at them and said, “Who calls me poor? I am rich, and I’m about to stand before my Lord as bold as a lion.” Those were her last words. Do you think that had an impact on the 15-year-old?</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Jehovah findeth none.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">She says, “I’m bold as a lion. Who calls me poor? It doesn’t matter what I’ve done. If I can look the justice of God in the eye, then I can spit in the eye of the world. Nothing will cow me?”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">Secondly, it’s the end of disappointment. If you understand Jesus Christ is your righteousness, he is your worthiness. He is that which enables you to stand before the Father. You won’t be as disappointed. Do you know why? Most of the things that disappoint us are things we have put our hopes in to give us meaning in life. This didn’t come through. This didn’t come through. This didn’t come through. What were these things we’ve lost? What were these things that have so shattered us? These were things that were our righteousness.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I’ll put it another way. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Most of our desires for success are actually our efforts to be for ourselves what only Jesus can really be for us. They’re our efforts to make ourselves feel like we’re really worthwhile and we really count. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">They’re our efforts to be our own advocates, our own defenses before the bar. “If only I could get this. If only I could get this. If only I could get this,” and it doesn’t happen, and we’re shattered. No longer is a Christian up and down emotionally over things like that, no longer, because none of these things can stand before you and be your advocate. None of these things prove you’re worthy. Jesus is your worthiness. John Newton put it:</span></p>

<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:9px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">If you want nobility, if you want greatness … Sometimes I read the journals and the biographies of the great men and women of God of history, and I say, “Where did they get what they had?” Sometimes they were able to be so bold, so confident, and actually so full of joy they could face down tyrannical kings and entire armies. Nothing fazed them. Were they made of a different race? Were they made of different stuff than us? No. They availed themselves of their Advocate. They had the very same resources you and I have.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">If you take this in, it’s the end of the guilt. It’s the end of constantly being disappointed. It’s the end of the self-consciousness. It’s the end of the meekness in the wrong kind of way. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">If we would really build a church of people that had even a significant minority in that church practicing and applying this doctrine every day, knowing Jesus is our Advocate, knowing we’re lost in our Advocate, do you realize what kind of church we’d have?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">It would be a church in which worship would be great, because Christians expect to go right into the presence of God. That’s the reason Jesus says, “You will see angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” Do you remember Jacob’s ladder? He saw angels coming up and down between earth and heaven. Jesus Christ will take you right into the throne room of God because you are perfect in the Father. He can bring you right in. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t expect that presence to come breaking into our lives every time we meet for worship.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">There’s something else. A church that’s filled with people who believe this would also be a church that’s not at all afraid to tell other people what he has done for them, because </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">the gospel is you’re more sinful than you ever dared believe, and you’re more accepted and loved than you ever dared hope.</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;"> Of course, those two things make us both humble and bold at the same time, and there’s nothing more winsome than that.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">If you’re humble and not bold, it’s because you think about your sin without thinking of the intercession of Christ, and, of course, you’re not that effective in talking to people. On the other hand, if you’re bold and not humble, it means you think you’re pretty good and you’re forgetting the fact you’re actually a wicked sinner and the only reason you’re able to stand before the Father is because you’re hidden in your Advocate. When boldness and humility go together, there’s a confidence, a lack of self-consciousness, but at the same time a sensitivity and a humility.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">There is no reason why we should not be able to communicate what Christ has done for us and attract people. There is nothing more attractive than the kind of bold, humble character that arises out of a grasp of the advocacy of Christ for you before the Father at this moment. Do you have that kind of attractiveness in your life? Do you have that kind of confidence? Do you have that kind of stability? Do you have that kind of guilt-free living? Then I say avail yourself of this one. Look to him. Remind yourself of what he has done.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:18px;"><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">I hope nobody thinks I’m glib. </span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt; color:#ff0000; background-color:#ffff00;">Unless he is your Advocate because you come to him and you give yourself to him now … If he’s not your Advocate when you appear before the judgment seat, the Bible tells us he will appear as your Prosecutor, and he will be just as effective in that role as he is in this one. I don’t say that glibly. I don’t say that to scare you. I just haven’t expounded the doctrine unless I tell you the truth, because in the middle of the good news is embedded the bad news, but the good news will overwhelm it if you come to the Father through him. “… he is able to save to the uttermost …</span><span style=" font-family:'Calibri'; font-size:14pt;">” Let’s pray.</span></p>
